# Notepad++
## Theme
### Trebnie.xml
Trebnie.xml is the Theme that I use in Notepad++. <br>
It's based on the Theme: Solarized by Ethan Schoonover
```
Just copy the file to the theme directory, by default: C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes
Restart Notepad++
Settings \ Style Configurator
Select Theme: Choose Trebnie
```
